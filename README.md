### **1. Introduction**  
Overstimulation occurs when an individual experiences excessive sensory input, mental overload, or prolonged exposure to stressors such as noise, social interactions, screen time, or multitasking. In today's fast-paced, technology-driven world, identifying and mitigating overstimulation is crucial for mental well-being and productivity.  

The **Overstimulation Detection Dataset** provides a structured way to analyze how different lifestyle factors contribute to overstimulation. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to predict overstimulation levels based on various behavioral and physiological indicators.

### **2. Understanding the Dataset**  
This dataset consists of **2000 samples** with **20 feature columns** and a **binary target variable** (`Overstimulated`). Each feature represents a lifestyle or behavioral factor that can contribute to overstimulation.  

#### **Key Features:**  
- **Demographics & Daily Habits**  
  - `Age`: Age of the individual  
  - `Sleep_Hours`: Hours of sleep per day  
  - `Work_Hours`: Hours worked per day  
  - `Exercise_Hours`: Time spent exercising  

- **Mental & Emotional Well-being**  
  - `Stress_Level`: Self-reported stress level (1-10)  
  - `Anxiety_Score`: Self-reported anxiety level (1-10)  
  - `Depression_Score`: Self-reported depression level (1-10)  
  - `Overthinking_Score`: How often the person overthinks  

- **External Influences**  
  - `Screen_Time`: Daily screen usage in hours  
  - `Noise_Exposure`: Exposure to loud environments (0-5 scale)  
  - `Social_Interaction`: Number of social interactions per day  
  - `Caffeine_Intake`: Number of caffeinated drinks consumed  

- **Physiological Factors**  
  - `Headache_Frequency`: Weekly headache occurrences  
  - `Irritability_Score`: Self-reported irritability (1-10)  
  - `Sleep_Quality`: Sleep quality (1-4 scale)  

The **target variable** is `Overstimulated` (1 = Yes, 0 = No), indicating whether the individual is experiencing overstimulation based on the provided factors.

### **3. Data Analysis & Visualization**  
Before building models, it's essential to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data distribution and relationships.  

#### **Univariate Analysis**  
- **Histogram & Density Plots**: Show distributions of continuous features like `Sleep_Hours`, `Screen_Time`, and `Stress_Level`.  
- **Bar Charts**: Show the proportion of overstimulated vs. non-overstimulated individuals.  

#### **Multivariate Analysis**  
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Identify the strongest relationships between features.  
- **Boxplots & Pairplots**: Examine how different factors (e.g., `Screen_Time`, `Work_Hours`) influence overstimulation.  
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Compare overstimulation rates across different age groups and habits.

### **4. Building Classification Models**  
To predict overstimulation, we apply **10 different classification models**, including:  

1. **Logistic Regression** - Baseline linear classifier  
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble learning with decision trees  
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Effective for complex relationships  
4. **Decision Tree** - Simple and interpretable tree-based model  
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Measures similarity for classification  
6. **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classification model  
7. **Gradient Boosting** - Boosted decision trees for higher accuracy  
8. **AdaBoost** - Adaptive boosting for better performance  
9. **Bagging Classifier** - Aggregates predictions from multiple classifiers  
10. **XGBoost** - Powerful gradient boosting algorithm  

Each model is trained and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare their performance.

### **5. Model Evaluation & Performance Comparison**  
- **Confusion Matrix**: To analyze true positives, false positives, etc.  
- **Classification Report**: Shows precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **ROC & AUC Curve**: Evaluates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.  
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Determines which factors contribute most to overstimulation.  

After comparing models, **hyperparameter tuning** is performed on the best models (e.g., **Random Forest, XGBoost**) to improve accuracy.
